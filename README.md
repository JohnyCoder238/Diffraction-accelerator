🌟 🌟 Optimized Diffraction Measurement to Reduce Time by 90% 💪 🌟
As the first part of my Diploma thesis, I've significantly accelerated diffraction measurement techniques, achieving a 90% reduction in time required. 🕒

Using the Grating equation, I identified the specific wavelengths diffracted at each angle and measured only those intervals instead of the entire spectra. This targeted approach saved a remarkable 70 to 97% of measurement time (varying with measurement parameters) 📉 without any impact on measured spectra's quality
The script was developed in SAX Basic (a variant of Visual Basic), as recommended by our spectrophotometer's manufacturer. Additionally, I used Python's Matplotlib to create dynamic animations to visualize our results. 🖥️✨
